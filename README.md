Lollms (Lord of Large Language Models) is a powerful library that provides a Flask backend to interact with LLMS (Large Language Models). Lollms for VS Code is an extension built on top of Lollms, designed to facilitate automatic code synthesis by leveraging LLMS capabilities. With Lollms for VS Code, users can write comments or prompts, and the AI generates code snippets based on the provided input.

## Features

- Seamless integration with Visual Studio Code.
- Utilizes LLMS for automatic code generation from user comments or prompts.
- Supports both local LLMS instances for offline usage and ChatGPT for cloud-based text generation.
- Requires an OpenAI API key with a paid plan for ChatGPT functionality.

## Installation

To install Lollms for VS Code, follow these steps:

1. Make sure you have Visual Studio Code installed on your machine.
2. Launch Visual Studio Code.

## Usage

1. Open a project or create a new file in Visual Studio Code.
2. Write a comment or prompt describing the code you want to generate.
3. Use the Lollms extension to send the comment or prompt to the AI for code generation.
4. Wait for the AI to process the input and generate the code snippet.
5. The generated code will be displayed within Visual Studio Code, ready for you to use or modify.
